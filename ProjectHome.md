IFC Soft is an open source data visualization program.

It is written in Java and JavaFX script (v. 1.3.1), which has unfortunately been [discontinued by java](https://blogs.oracle.com/javafx/entry/javafx_1_2_and_javafx).

  * See the user site now on our [user page](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kthayer/ifcsoft/). NOTE: The program no longer works due to [Java no longer supporting it](https://blogs.oracle.com/javafx/entry/javafx_1_2_and_javafx).
  * Read the statement of [Purpose](Purpose.md) for the project.
  * You are invited to [Participate](Participate.md).
  * [Download](http://code.google.com/p/ifcsoft/source/checkout) the code and read the [CodeOverview](CodeOverview.md).

Kyle Thayer's [Masters Thesis](http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/91mbm) using IFC Soft is now available for download.
