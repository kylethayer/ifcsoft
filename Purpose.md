# Purpose #

> IFC Soft is an open source web-app that visualizes and analyzes multi-dimensional data sets intuitively, interactively and using novel approaches.


**Web-App:**

The program is a Rich Internet Application that can be run from a web browser without having to be installed. It is written in Java and JavaFX.


**Multi-Dimensional Data Sets:**

The software is specifically aimed for analyzing [flow cytometry](FlowCytometry.md) data, which generally has between 3 and 16 dimensions and from ten-thousand to one million data points per sample. Any other numerical multi-dimensional data should work in the program (eg. Any data on a large number of individual cells, people, cities, countries, etc.)


**Intuitive:**

The displays and controls should allow for the most intuitive comprehension of the displayed data and interaction with the program.


**Interactive:**

The displays should allow the user to interact with the data, selecting and saving subsets of the data or statistics about the selection.


**Novel Approaches:**

Besides conventional approaches such as histograms and scatter plots, this program uses [Self-Organizing Maps](http://mathcs.emory.edu/~kthayer/ifcsoft/som.html) and [Wind-Rose Charts](WRC.md) .
